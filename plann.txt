- or do full validation?
  give schema for quiz
  how to use it
    initialize with schema

design decisions
  API
    simple explicit function names instead of fancy chaining
      encourage shallow states
      intuitive and small
    must pass key
      for explicitness
    array of strings for nested state
      alternative to chaining
      simpler logging than building a chainable store
      more functional
  to enforce planning state
    type enforcement
    key existence enforcement at initiation (if strict === true)
  error-happy: for strict habiting




api ideas
  - reading and writing nested state
  https://github.com/chandlerprall/insula
  ! https://github.com/marcuswestin/store.js/
    nested state: array of strings
  https://github.com/rhyolight/JavaScript-Data-Store
    get('key.nestedKey')
  support partial state?
    probably not
